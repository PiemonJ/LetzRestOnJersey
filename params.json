Jersey made easy to understand with sample standard REST service\r\n\r\n2.  Jersey-Spring integration\r\n\r\n3.  POJO mapping feature of jersey (converting java object to the JSON)\r\n\r\n4.  Jersey, spring with maven enabled\r\n\r\n5.\tTest cases for unit testing  Resources using Jersey Test framework to keep the code reliable\r\n\r\n6.\tException handling via exception mappers to keep code robus\r\n\r\n7.\tHateOAS support via annotation (Newly introduced and interesting part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###  Acknowledgements : thanks to the support from Vinay in adding the features while building the project\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
